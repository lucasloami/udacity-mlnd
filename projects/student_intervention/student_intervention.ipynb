Weaknesses: this model is easy to overfit; calculations of it can be very complex; it's an instable model since it can changes a lot with a small pertubation in the data (referecens can be found [here](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-disadvantages-of-using-a-decision-tree-for-classification) and {here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree#Advantages_and_disadvantages))\n",
